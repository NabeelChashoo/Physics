				<h2>About CERN</h2>
					<p>What is the universe made of? How did it start? Physicists at CERN are seeking answers, using some of the world's most powerful particle accelerators</p>
					<p>At CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, physicists and engineers are probing the fundamental structure of the universe. They use the world's largest and most complex scientific instruments to study the basic constituents of matter - the fundamental particles. The particles are made to collide together at close to the speed of light. The process gives the physicists clues about how the particles interact, and provides insights into the fundamental laws of nature.</p>
					<p>The instruments used at CERN are purpose-built particle accelerators and detectors. Accelerators boost beams of particles to high energies before the beams are made to collide with each other or with stationary targets. Detectors observe and record the results of these collisions.</p>
					<p>Founded in 1954, the CERN laboratory sits astride the Franco-Swiss border near Geneva. It was one of Europe's first joint ventures and now has 22 member states.</p>
				<h2>The name CERN</h2>
					<p>The name CERN is derived from the acronym for the French "Conseil Europ&eacute;en pour la Recherche Nucl&eacute;aire", or European Council for Nuclear Research, a provisional body founded in 1952 with the mandate of establishing a world-class fundamental physics research organization in Europe. At that time, pure physics research concentrated on understanding the inside of the atom, hence the word "nuclear".</p>
					<p>Today, our understanding of matter goes much deeper than the nucleus, and CERN's main area of research is particle physics - the study of the fundamental constituents of matter and the forces acting between them. Because of this, the laboratory operated by CERN is often referred to as the European Laboratory for Particle Physics</p>
